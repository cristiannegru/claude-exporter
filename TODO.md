  - Support for Original/Markdown/Text/JSON formats
  - Code files always kept in original format
  - Non-code markdown documents convert to selected format

- **Flat artifacts export** (v1.4.0)
  - Independent from nested artifacts option
  - Both can be enabled simultaneously for dual export
  - Flat: exports with `ConversationName_filename` prefix

- **UI reorganization** (v1.5.0-1.5.1)
  - Header 1: Title (left), Stats (right)
  - Header 2: Projects dropdown (left), Search (center), Export controls (right)
  - Removed Model filter dropdown (use column sorting instead)
  - Wider search bar (400px → 500px)
  - Wider table container (1400px → 1600px)

- **Artifact extraction fixes** (v1.5.2)
  - Added support for `code_block` display format (newer artifacts)
  - Maintained support for `json_block` format (older artifacts)
  - Fixed missing artifacts in newer conversations

- **Nested/Flat independence** (v1.5.3)
  - Made nested and flat artifact exports independent options
  - Can export in one or both formats simultaneously

- **Export filename improvements** (v1.5.4)
  - Changed from date to datetime format
  - Format: `claude-exports-2025-10-31_14-30-45.zip`
  - Prevents file collisions on same-day exports

- **Progress bar accuracy** (v1.5.4)
  - Fixed to count all scanned conversations
  - Includes skipped conversations (no artifacts when chats disabled)

- **Projects API support** (v1.6.0)
  - Fetch projects from `/api/organizations/{orgId}/projects`
  - Populate Projects dropdown with user's projects
  - Filter conversations by selected project
  - Renamed export files from 'claude-conversations-*' to 'claude-exports-*'

- **Flat artifacts bug fix** (v1.6.1)

  - Now extracts artifacts if EITHER nested OR flat is checked

- **Projects column** (v1.6.2)
  - Added 'Project' column after 'Name' column
  - Display project name or '-' if no project assigned
  - Full sorting capability for Project column
  - Multi-level sorting with shift+click

- **Flat-only artifacts export** (v1.7.0)
  - When ONLY 'Artifacts flat' is checked (no chats, no nested):
    - Export all artifacts from all conversations into single root folder
    - No conversation subfolders - everything in one big folder
    - Each artifact prefixed with conversation name
    - Filename: `claude-artifacts-{timestamp}.zip` (distinguishes from other exports)

- **Firefox support** (v1.8.0-1.8.1)

  - Claude Sonnet 4.6 model support
  - Smart model name parsing (no more hardcoded lookup table)
  - Removed `plaintext` language tag from thinking/pasted code blocks

- **Bulk export & script injection fixes** (v1.8.8)
  - Export All from popup now always creates a ZIP (was downloading individual files for markdown/text)
  - JSON Export All now fetches full conversation data per chat (was only exporting summary list)
  - background.js re-injects all three content scripts on reload (fixes "not defined" errors)
  - Removed stale export_summary.json toast reference

- **Automatic organization ID detection** (v1.8.12)
  - Auto-detects org ID from Claude.ai API on every export action (always fresh)
  - Eliminates manual configuration step for most users
  - Falls back to stored org ID if auto-detect fails
  - Fixes issue where manually-set org ID becomes stale

- **New/updated conversation tracking** (v1.8.13)
  - Green dot indicator for conversations not yet exported or updated since last export
  - Status filter dropdown (All / New+Updated / Previously exported)
  - Auto-selects new/updated conversations on browse page load
  - Export timestamps tracked across all export flows

- **Settings dropdown menu** (v1.9.0)
  - Gear icon replaces theme toggle on browse page, opens dropdown
  - Theme toggle, org ID display, mark all exported/new, test connection
  - Gear icon in popup header opens options page

## Pending 🔄

- **Contact dev / feedback link** (medium priority)
  - Add to settings dropdown on browse page
  - Way for users to reach out (feedback, bug reports)

- **In-popup changelog / "What's new"** (low priority)
  - Show users a summary of changes on version bump
  - Surfaces UI updates so changes aren't jarring

- **Elaborate README acknowledgments** (low priority)
  - Expand "Written in collaboration with Claude Code" with more detail
  - Could include model history, specific contributions, or workflow notes

- **Branch export options**
  - Add option to export all branches vs. only current branch
  - Currently markdown/text only export current branch, JSON exports all
  - Let users choose their preference for all formats
  - Useful for preserving alternate conversation paths

- **Claude Code export**
  - Support exporting Claude Code conversations
  - Handle code-specific content and artifacts

- **PDF export for artifacts**
  - Generate PDF versions of artifacts
  - Useful for documentation and sharing

- **Filter bash tool uses from artifact extraction**
  - Sometimes simple bash calls create artifact.sh files
  - Need to better distinguish real artifacts from tool use results
  - Check for additional indicators beyond just `filename` field

- **Artifact search/filter in browse view**
  - Add ability to search or filter conversations by artifact content
  - Filter by artifact filename, type, or whether artifacts exist
  - Helps find specific artifacts across all conversations

- **Export progress indicator on browse page**
  - Show progress bar when exporting from browse view
  - Display current conversation being processed
  - Provide visual feedback during large exports

- **Memory export (global and project-specific)**
  - Export custom instructions and memory from Claude.ai
  - Support both global/account-level memory and project-specific memory
  - Allow backup and archival of configured AI behavior and context

- **Advanced date/time format settings**
  - Custom format string (e.g. `%d/%m/%Y %H:%M`)
  - Toggle time display on/off
  - Other advanced formatting options beyond M/D/Y, D/M/Y, 12h/24h

- **Model name/ID toggle in table**
  - Click on model name to toggle between display name and model ID

- **Artifact indicators in browse table**
  - Show icon next to conversation name if it contains artifacts
  - Add filter options in funnel dropdown: with artifacts / without artifacts

- **Regex search**
  - Option to use regex patterns in the search bar
  - Toggle between plain text and regex mode

- **Google Drive integration**
  - Link/sync exports to Google Drive

- **UI cleanup: Remove redundant "View" button**
  - Chat name already links to conversation, "View" button may be unnecessary

- **Local sync / export folder mode**
  - User defines a local export directory
  - Extension compares current Claude data against exported files to detect changes
  - Git-like approach: diff actual content, not just timestamps
  - More accurate than timestamp-based new/updated detection
  - Timestamp-based tracking (green dots) remains as the default for users who don't configure a folder
  - Would need File System Access API or similar for folder read/write
  - Consider: incremental sync (only export changed conversations) vs full re-export


- **Help / tutorial in settings menu**
  - Add a help/getting started option to the settings dropdown
  - Quick overview of features, export options, keyboard shortcuts

- **Click org ID to copy to clipboard**
  - In settings dropdown, clicking org ID copies it with visual feedback (tooltip/toast)

- **Improve model badge color contrast in light mode** (low priority)
  - Model name badges (Sonnet/Opus/Haiku) may be hard to read in light theme
  - Increase text/background contrast for accessibility

- **Localization / i18n** (low priority)
  - Detect user's browser language and display UI in their language
  - Use Chrome/Firefox i18n APIs (`chrome.i18n`, `_locales/` folder)
  - Start with English, add community-contributed translations

- **Remove claude.ai tab dependency** (low priority)
  - Use `chrome.cookies` API to read claude.ai session cookies directly
  - Make API calls from background worker / browse page without needing a relay tab
  - Would allow browse page and auto-detection to work without an open claude.ai tab
  - Requires adding `cookies` permission to manifest

## Bugs 🐛

(none currently open)

## Current Version: 1.9.0

## Notes

- Version bumping helps track changes and catch branch mix-ups
- Projects fully implemented and functional
- All artifact export features are functional and tested
- Flat-only mode makes it easy to get all artifacts in one searchable folder
