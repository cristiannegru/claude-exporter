  - Both can be enabled simultaneously for dual export
  - Flat: exports with `ConversationName_filename` prefix

  - Added support for `code_block` display format (newer artifacts)
  - Maintained support for `json_block` format (older artifacts)
  - Fixed missing artifacts in newer conversations

- **Nested/Flat independence** (v1.5.3)
  - Made nested and flat artifact exports independent options
  - Can export in one or both formats simultaneously

- **Export filename improvements** (v1.5.4)
  - Changed from date to datetime format
  - Format: `claude-exports-2025-10-31_14-30-45.zip`
  - Prevents file collisions on same-day exports

- **Progress bar accuracy** (v1.5.4)
  - Fixed to count all scanned conversations

  - Multi-level sorting with shift+click

- **Flat-only artifacts export** (v1.7.0)
  - When ONLY 'Artifacts flat' is checked (no chats, no nested):
    - Export all artifacts from all conversations into single root folder
    - No conversation subfolders - everything in one big folder
    - Each artifact prefixed with conversation name
    - Filename: `claude-artifacts-{timestamp}.zip` (distinguishes from other exports)

  - Removed stale export_summary.json toast reference
